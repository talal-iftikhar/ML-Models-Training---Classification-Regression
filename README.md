# 🥑 Avocado Price Prediction and Classification Project 📊

Welcome to the **Avocado Price Prediction and Classification** project! This repository contains my university semester project, where I analyzed the **Avocado Prices Dataset** to build and evaluate models for predicting:

1. The **type** of avocado (classification).
2. The **average price** of avocados (regression).

## 🌟 Project Highlights
- **Dataset**: Avocado Prices Dataset, containing features like region, date, type, and average price.
- **Models**: Implementation of both **classification** and **regression** tasks using popular machine learning algorithms.
- **Results**: Comparative analysis of model performance, addressing overfitting, underfitting, and error analysis.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
1. **Predict the type of avocado** (conventional or organic) using classification models.
2. **Predict the average price of avocados** using regression models.
3. Compare model performance using metrics:
   - **Classification**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.
   - **Regression**: MAE, MSE, R² Score.
4. Analyze errors, overfitting, and underfitting in different models.
5. Optimize models through hyperparameter tuning.
